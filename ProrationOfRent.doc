Your rent for the above address is $rentAmt per month. The rent is due on the first of every month.

You are getting the apartment on the moveInDate of moveInMonth, so your rent for nextMonth will be prorated. The amount of rent due on the first of nextMonth is $proratedRentAmt.

Then on thirdMonth first you will owe $rentAmt and every month thereafter on the first.

Thank you,
